Learn the basics about functions in JavaScript:

1. Basic theory about functions in JavaScript.
2. Learn the syntax on how to create functions.
3. How to call functions.
4. What are function parameters and the return statement.
5. How to create traditional, arrow and anonymous functions.
6. Use functions in different scenarios, like for replacing vowels in a string.

These exercises are intent to be built by collaboration, we need you! If you find any bugs or misspells please contribute and report them.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/javascript-functions-exercises-tutorial) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-functions-exercises-tutorial).

> Once you have VSCode open, if exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

1. Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the node compiler plugin for LearnPack, make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```bash
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-node
```

2. Download this particular exercise using LearnPack and `cd` into the folder:

```bash
$ learnpack download javascript-functions-exercises-tutorial
$ cd javascript-functions-exercises-tutorial
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find an "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
$ learnpack start
```

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **app.js:** represents the entry file for the exercise.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
